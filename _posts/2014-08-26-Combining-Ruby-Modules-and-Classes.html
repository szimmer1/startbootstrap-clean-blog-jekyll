title: Combining Ruby Modules and Classes

<p><b>Ah, summer...</b></p>
<p>I'm currently learning Ruby on Rails.  As a total beginner to Ruby,
this task has proven to be a difficult undertaking. To an experienced
programmer, I'm sure that picking up another language is a small matter of 
learning syntax and then
a few new ways of organizing scopes and abstract data types.
However, to someone like me, who only really started programming a few months
ago and has working knowledge of exactly <em>one</em> language, Java, learning 
a language like Ruby ain't a cakewalk. I've decided to write regular
instructive posts on the language in order to help myself solidify my own understanding
as well as anyone finding themselves in this part of the internet.<br>

<h3>Differences between Ruby and Java</h3>
<p>In Java, we have <em>classes</em>, which define an instance of the class (object) and way to manipulate it
(methods, both static and instance). For example, we may have a class definition of a <code>Rational</code> number
extending <code>Integer</code>:
{% highlight Java%}
class Rational extends Integer {
  //private class variables
  private int numerator;
  private int denominator;

  //initializers
  public Rational(int num, int denom) {
    numerator = num;
    denominator = denom;
    }

  public Rational(){
    numerator = 0;
    denominator = 1; //in reality you can't divide by 0
  }
  
  //instance method
  public int getNum() {
    return this.numerator;
  }

  //static method
  public static Rational add(Rational one,Rational two) {
  Rational sum = new Rational();
  sum.denominator = GCD(one.denominator + two.denominator);
  sum.numerator = one.numerator * (GCD/one.denominator) + two.numerator * (GCD/two.denominator);
  return sum;
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>What we've done is extended the <code>Integer</code> class,  which let's say provides us a <code class="method">GCD</code> method,
to a <code>Rational</code> class which includes class variables, instance initializers, and a static "class" method <code class="method">add</code>. 
Importantly, <b>all class methods must be defined within the class</b>. This makes it tedious to rewrite methods that often use similar parameters.</p>

<p>In Ruby, several things are different. You don't have to declare class variables. You don't have to define class and instance methods within the class.
You can define a method that deals with an instance of the class, <em>outside of the class definition</em>, in a module.
For example, let's implement <code>Rational</code> in Ruby:</p>
{% highlight ruby %}
class Rational < Integer
  # initializer
  def initialize(*ints)
    @num, @denom = ints
  end

  # accessors
  attr_accessor :denom
  attr_accessor :num
end
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Yup, that's pretty much all you need in a class definition in Ruby. To get the instance method, <code>get_num</code> (changed for Ruby naming convention)
, and the static method, <code>add</code>,
we use two different Ruby <em>modules</em>. Modules exist in Ruby to allow inheritance of methods without inheritance of the entire parent class. Multiple classes
can <em>mix in</em> a module to share common API methods easily. Our first module will be for <code>get_num</code>:
{% highlight ruby %}
module GetNums
  def get_num 
    @num
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}
Our second module:
{% highlight ruby %}
module Add
  def add(*nums) 
    sum = Rational.new
    sum.denom = GCD(nums.denom)
    nums.each do |num|
      sum.num += GCD/num.denom * num.num
    end
    return sum
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}
<blockquote>A nice feature on ruby is the ability to include an undetermined number of arguments, <code>*args</code> in methods</blockquote>
<p>You may be wondering why we made a module for instance methods and a module for static methods instead of making one module containing both. The reason is 
that Ruby only allows mixing in of either instance methods <em>or</em> static methods at any one time. We use the <code>require</code> keyword to mix in static methods
and the <code>include</code> keyword to mix in instance methods (i for instance!). I don't know if we could just use both keywords on a single module that has both instance
and static methods; that'd be a good experiment. Now we mix in our modules into our Ruby <code>Rational</code> class:

<blockquote>One interesting thing about Ruby is that instance variables <em>are never private</em>. Anyone can access or overwrite an instance variable if they
know it using <code>object.instance_variable_get(:@var)</code>. While this is a strength for usability, it seems to me like a pretty major security issue.</blockquote>
{% highlight ruby %}
class Rational < Integer

  include GetNums

  require Add

  # initializer
  def initialize(*ints)
    @num, @denom = ints
  end

  # accessors
  attr_accessor :denom
  attr_accessor :num
end
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Now we can use our Ruby class to do the stuff the methods do:</p>
{% highlight ruby %}
real = Rational.new(5,6)
puts real.get_num

real2 = Rational.new(7,8)
puts add(real,real1)
{% endhighlight %}
