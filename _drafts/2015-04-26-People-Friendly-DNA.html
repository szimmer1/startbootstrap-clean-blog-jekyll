<p>
    There are only 4 base pairs in DNA. That means we only need 2 bits to represent a single base pair,
    and less than a byte to represent a codon (the DNA code unit that is translated into an amino acid, which in turn form proteins).
    DNA is highly usable as code, as the last 50 years of biology have taught us. Nature has been using DNA as its code
    since the first ribosomes appeared.
</p>
<p>
    The obvious followup to that idea is this: why can't we create languages to help people understand and manipulate DNA,
    in the same way we've written programming languages to help people manipulate computers? Looking at DNA as the 1's and 0's of the
    human body, it's somewhat easy to convince myself that DNA is like machine code, except for cells.
</p>
<p>
    And in many ways, it is. Here's a few similarities:
</p>
<h3>Transcription</h3>
<p>
    The essential step for cells to use DNA is to convert it to translatable form, or single-stranded RNA.
    Biologists have known for years that certain regions of DNA cause nearby regions to be transcribed more often. For example, a
    "TATA" box (sequence of alternating T's and A's) is necessary for a transcriptor protein to bind to a region of DNA before turning
     a gene into RNA. This could be programmed. Many other DNA elements either upstream or downstream of genes affect transcription, including
    "activator" and "inhibitor" sequences which can utterly stop transcription or even <i>control the rate</i> of transcription.
    Transcription is probably the most programmable part of DNA because it is the true "control center" of which genes go out and
    get turned into proteins
</p>
<h3>Splicing</h3>
<p>
    The second most programmable part of DNA is with respect to splicing. Several genetic diseases are thought to be caused by errors
    in splicing, such as cystic fibrosis, familial isolated growth hormone deficiency, and Parkinsons <a href="http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/17/4/419.full.html">(source)</a>.
    Splicing is affected by RNA sequences on introns where a splicing protein attaches and breaks off un-wanted RNA. These intron sequences can be
    programmed on DNA, because RNA is a function of DNA.
</p>
<h3>Translation</h3>
<p>
    This is where genes become proteins and have subsequently have direct effect on cellular processes. If we could program DNA, we could
    obviously choose different sequences of amino acids to produce programmed proteins. Nature doesn't always get this step right either, as
    evidenced by translation errors resulting in diseases like dyskeratosis congenia, sickle cell anemia, encephalopathy, and others <a href="http://www.nature.com/scitable/content/translation-matters-protein-synthesis-defects-in-inherited-13998175">(source)</a>.
</p>
<h3>But we aren't like computers, and DNA isn't like machine code</h3>
<p>
    DNA doesn't take discrete, reproducible commands. We don't definitely know how one change in DNA will affect other processes. The function of DNA is context-dependent - a full DNA sequence
    may activate a gene, while the second half of that same sequence might code for a different gene. Effects of changing a single sequence
    of DNA are not necessarily mutually exclusive. This is why many people including me would say that programming DNA from scratch is a fool's errand.
    We simply don't know how enough to predict what will happen when we put the pieces together.
</p>
<p>
    However, we do know and have known for a while, what will happen if we take a working piece of DNA and switch out one or two sequences
    for sequences of our liking. This is called transformation. Perhaps a language to perform transformations on DNA rather than build it from scratch,
    is closer to reality. Maybe data analysis and comparison (alignment) between different sequences, which is a common problem. Or maybe just
    for the classroom. For funsies.
